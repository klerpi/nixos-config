# My NixOS configuration files

These are not general purpose (especially the `hardware-configuration.nix`) but perhaps they can be used as inspiration.

You'll need both the `nix-command` and `flakes` experimental features activated.

A new generation can be built by running:

```bash
sudo ./rebuild.sh
```

## Acknowledgements

This configuration is heavily inspired by the minimal version of [Misterio77/nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).
